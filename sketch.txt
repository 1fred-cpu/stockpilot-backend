🔑 Key Concepts in Your Setup

User → Represents the actual person (auth, email, password, profile).

Business → A company/account that owns stores.

Store → A physical/digital store under a business.

Relations:

User → Business (many-to-one, user belongs to a business)

User → Store (optional, e.g., store manager or staff)

Business → Store (one-to-many)

🛠️ Sign-up Workflow
Step 1: User Registration

What happens:

User signs up with email + password (via Supabase Auth or your NestJS backend).

At this point, they have no business and no store.

Data saved:

Insert into users table with:

id (uuid, matches auth ID from Supabase or generated in your system)

email, name

business_id = NULL

store_id = NULL

status = "pending_setup" (to indicate they haven’t registered a business yet)

UX flow:
→ Redirect them to “Register Business” page.

Step 2: Business Registration

What happens:

User fills in business details (name, type, country, etc.).

A businesses record is created.

Optionally, create a default store (e.g., “Main Store”) automatically.

Data saved:

Insert businesses row.

Insert stores row (default or user-provided).

Update users row:

business_id = business.id

store_id = default_store.id (or leave null if store isn’t required immediately)

status = "active"

UX flow:
→ Redirect to Dashboard with their new business + store context.

Step 3: Dashboard Access

What happens:

User is fully set up (business + store linked).

They can invite other users (employees).

Data:

Normal business + store relations in place.

UX flow:

Show them analytics, products, etc.

⚠️ Edge Case: User Signs In Without a Business

This will definitely happen (if they registered but didn’t finish setup).

When user logs in:

Check if user.business_id IS NULL.

If yes → redirect to Register Business.

If they belong to a business but not a store, either:

Assign them to the default store automatically, OR

Redirect them to “Select/Create Store” page.

🔄 Suggested Status/Flags for User

To manage flows cleanly, I’d add a status column in users:

pending_setup → signed up but no business.

active → has business & store.

invited → invited by another business but not activated yet.

This way, you can branch logic on login.
